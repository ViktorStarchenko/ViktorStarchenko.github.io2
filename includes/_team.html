Xiaoying and Tom got to know each other while working as freelancers on Google projects and became good friends. They firmly believe with the right resource, solopreneurs and small teams can execute beautiful products too. Thus they made AppKit to help developers and startups make outstanding products - the internet has made it possible for the "small guys" to compete directly with the "big guys".</p></div><div class="row team__content text-center"><div class="col-lg-6-col-m-12"><div class="team__member-wrapper"><img src="img/team-1.png"/><h4>Xiaoying Riley</h4><h3>Full-Stack Designer</h3><div class="team-links"><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a></div><p>Xiaoying is the UX/UI designer behind AppKit.
